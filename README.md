# BlackHoleSimulation
Implementation of a black hole simulation in Unity for the Microsoft Hololens.
Our focus of this project is to provide educators with an interactable black hole using real equations, to inspire more students to persue Astronomy and Computer Science.

## Changelog
The current implementation features room to skybox mapping, so we are now able to use the user's room inside of the simulation. This version also contains the newtonian physics for orbiting, with an example moon around the black hole.
